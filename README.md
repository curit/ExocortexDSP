ExocortexDSP
============

A C# open source library that provides fully featured (1) single and double precision complex number data types, (2) complex number math library, (3) 1D, 2D and 3D complex and real symmetric fast Fourier transforms, and (4) highly accurate statistical routines.  The library is optimized for both speed and numerical accuracy.  The reason that this library is called a "Digital Signal Processing" library is because complex numbers, FFTs and statistical functions form the basis of any DSP library -- although it is the hope that this library will continue to evolve to a more full fledged DSP library.
